<div>Typically, we have imperfect tests for presence or absence of disease. This can be accounted for as well. We'll start by adjusting for this by including herd sensitivity (HSe) and herd specificity (HSp) in the calculation. HSe is defined as the probability of detecting a herd as postive if the true status of the herd is positive and HSp is the probability of detecting a herd as negative if the true state is negative. If both HSe and HSp are 1 then the samples size does not change from the crude estimate above.</div>
