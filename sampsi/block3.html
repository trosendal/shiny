<div>If we do not know the HSe then we can estimate the value based on the Test sensitivity (Se). Then we also need to know the average herd size and the expected within-herd prevalance in herds that are positive and the number of samples that we plan to collect in each herd. In this case herd size is expressed as whatever the unit of analysis is. For example, if we go to a farm and collect and test samples from individuals then the herd size and number of samples should be expressed in units of animals. If we go to a farm and collect and test samples from pens, the units are the 'pens'.</div>
